  ## Description
   This is a fully-responsive mock E-Commerce site where a user can create an account, login, and add/remove items to their shopping cart.  The user's shopping cart will have item totals updated both within the cart and by changing totals in the item card and the total shopping cart cost will also be updated accordingly.  The user can then proceed to checkout using the Stripe API to handle payment processing.
